# Credit Card Approval Using ANN
<br>

## Background

For many years banks used credit scoring techniques to determine which loan applicants they should lend money to. They do this by considering the applicants credit score. Credit score in simple words can be defined as the score that represents the credit worthiness of individual; better the credit score of the applicant, greater is the chance of his/her loan application to get accepted. 
<br> The decision whether the applicant is eligible for loan can be calculated by considering various instances/variables of an individual such as the monthly installment rate, credit card score(fico), purpose of loan , debt to income ratio, the number of times the borrower has been late etc.

## Case Study

The purpose of this research is to examine how well neural networks can work in providing accurate and reliable results for credit card approval. Using NN for credit scoring is actually utilizing a model or a method for evaluating the variables in order to kmow the credit worthiness of the applicant. Through this research we are trying to find to what level of accuracy NN can be used as a tool for credit card approvals in banks.
